(How input works as of right.... NOW!)

Right Mouse Click : Used to select objects (ie ships and such)
--------Hold shift to select multiple objects
--------Don't hold shift and select any point in space (ie not an object) to deselect all objects

Left Mouse hold: Used to change where the camera looks at

W: Camera move up
A: Camera move left
S: Camera move down
D: Camera move right
Q: Camera move up
Z: Camera move down

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My plans for input in the future
Right mouse click: Select objects... (same as before)
Middle mouse hold: Change camera's look at point
Left click: Other actions... perhaps pull up menu of options... (whatever is necessary at the time)

W,A,S,D: Might be the same??

Hotkeys for object actions (ie move, attack)
M: Pull up move cursor (then use left click to pick point)
R: Pull up rotate cursor (^^^)
F: Pull up attack cursor (^^^)
B: Pull up box select cursor
